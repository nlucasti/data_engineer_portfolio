# Data Modeling with Postgres
### A Udacity Project

## About the Dataset
The data used for this project is made up of two sets. One set consists of subset of data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains data about each song. The other set consist of log files in JSON format. These log files are generated by a random event simulator based on the songs of the above data set.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to build a database for a streaming app called Sparkify. The company wants to understand what songs users listen to. Before this project, the company had a lot of data, howeverm they had no easy way to query their data or even examine it on a large scale. Therefore, the need for a database with query-based optimization was necessary. 

## Database Design
A star schema was used for this dataset because the data wasn't overly complex, yet there had to be a way to access each dimension table. Here, we use the songplay table as the fact table and each of the other tables (users, songs, artists, and time) are our dimension tables. We do this because the most important data for Sparkify is the songplay data. Therefore, queries through this table are optimized based on the fact that they don't rely on joins. I then optimized the dimension tables using keys so that in the event that joins are required, they can be completed faster.
